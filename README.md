# FlixList
FlixList is a Watch List application that is designed for users that want to keep track of new or favourite movies. Users can search for movies, save them to their personal watchlist, and mark them as watched once they've seen them. The real-time movie information on the application is included through The Movie Database (TMDb), this allows the application to include things such as trending films and live ratings. When using the application users can also browse and leave comments on movies, allowing others to see their honest review. The application onboards users and tracks their watchlist (including adding and updating content i.e. have watched/havenâ€™t watched yet).
